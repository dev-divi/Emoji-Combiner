Exploring the Future of Emoji Communication

# Concept 

Consider an Emoji like a 'Letter' of the Emoji Alphabet  
Consider a combination of Emoji to create a 'Word'. 

# System 

Because Emoji are expressed as a symbolic image visualized, an 'Emoji Word' can be compressed to be expressed as one symbol. 
Take 3 Emoji and combine them, 🔥🍋🌎, you could create one new symbol, a fire-lemon-world image. This new symbol could be used with other new symbols to create new Emoji Words. 

Instead of creating 'new' Unicode emojis, we can compress combinations of the images we already have to create new symbols with enhanced meaning. 
This can be built on top of the existing unicode set of emojis with no consensus required.
